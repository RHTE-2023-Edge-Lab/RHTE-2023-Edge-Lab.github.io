# RHTE 2023 Edge Lab

Welcome, dear Red Hatter, in this Lab where you will discover a part of the Red Hat Edge offering.

You will play with the following technologies: 

* ESP8266
* MQTT
* AMQ Broker
* AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka Broker)
* OpenShift
* Camel-K

And if you plan to have a look under the hood, you will learn about:

* Quarkus
* ArgoCD
* Camel
* Kafka Streams
* Kafka MirrorMaker2

In this lab, you will be at the head of a shipping and delivery company, with multiple warehouses and you will deploy everything needed to: read the parcel RFID (using arduino and ESP32), send data to a MQTT broker over wifi, transform those data using Camel-K and send relevant events to the headquarter for reporting.

An application at the headquarter will display the parcels moving from one hub to another in realtime.

Team work and fun are expected ahead!
