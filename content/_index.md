From the ESP32 to the OpenShift cluster: discover what Red Hat can offer for the Edge computing!

Through the common theme of "shipment tracking", this lab will help you understand what Red Hat can offer for the Edge computing.

In this lab, you will be at the head of a "parcel shipment hub" and you will deploy a everything needed to : read the parcel RFID (using arduino and ESP32), send data to a MQTT broker over wifi, transform those data using Camel-K and send relevant events to the headquarter for reporting.

An application at the headquarter will display the parcels moving from one hub to another in realtime.

Fun is expected !
