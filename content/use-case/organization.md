At your table, there should be six persons and there should be ten tables.
During this lab, you will work in pair programming (that is to say: three duo).

* Duo **A** is in charge of implementing the code on ESP8266 to scan the **incoming** parcels using RFID and send the data over MQTT.
* Duo **B** is in charge of implementing the code on ESP8266 to scan the **outgoing** parcels using RFID and send the data over MQTT.
* Duo **C** is in charge of setting up Kafka Broker, MirrorMaker2 and implementing the Camel-K integration.
* Duo **A** or **B** (whoever finishes first) is in charge of deploying the MQTT broker.
