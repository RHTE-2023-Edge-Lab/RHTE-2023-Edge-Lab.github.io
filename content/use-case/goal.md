Your goal will be to deploy everything needed to: read the parcel RFID (using arduino and ESP32), send data to a MQTT broker over wifi, transform those data using Camel-K and send relevant events over Kafka to the headquarter for reporting.

The headquarter is already setup and is waiting for your data!

Once your setup is complete, you should be able to scan your parcels (look around you, there should be four parcels on your table!) and see them move over the global map.
